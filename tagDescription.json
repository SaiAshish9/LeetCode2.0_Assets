    "The problem typically involves representing a network as a graph, where nodes represent entities (such as computers or routers) and edges represent connections between these entities. The task is to find all the critical connections in the network, i.e., the edges whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the graph.",
    "One common approach to solving this problem is by using Tarjan's algorithm for finding articulation points and bridges in an undirected graph. In this algorithm, you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph, keeping track of certain properties of the nodes and edges encountered during the traversal.",
    "Here's a high-level overview of the algorithm:",
    "1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph, starting from any node\n2. During the traversal, maintain a timestamp for each node indicating when it was visited.\n3. Keep track of the lowest timestamp reachable from each node in the DFS traversal, which helps in identifying back edges.\n4. If you encounter a back edge (an edge to an ancestor in the DFS tree), update the lowest reachable timestamp for the corresponding node.\n5. If the lowest reachable timestamp of a child node is greater than or equal to the timestamp of the current node, then the edge connecting them is a critical connection.",

    "Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by processing individual digits. It is particularly effective when the range of possible key values is not too large and is well-suited for sorting large lists of integers. Radix sort can be performed using either the least significant digit (LSD) or the most significant digit (MSD) method.\n\nHere's an overview of both methods:\n\nRadix sort can be a suitable choice for problems involving sorting large lists of integers or strings where the maximum value or length is not excessively large.\n\nLSD Radix Sort (Least Significant Digit)\n\n1. Initialize:\n   - Start with the least significant digit (rightmost).\n   \n2. Sorting:\n   - Group the numbers based on the current digit being considered.\n   - Sort the numbers within each group.\n\n3. Repeat:\n   - Move to the next significant digit to the left and repeat the process.\n   - Continue until the most significant digit is processed.\n\nMSD Radix Sort (Most Significant Digit)\n\n1. Initialize:\n   - Start with the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\n2. Sorting:\n   - Group the numbers based on the current digit being considered.\n   - Sort the numbers within each group.\n\n3. Recursion:\n   - Recursively sort the groups using the next significant digit to the right.\n   - Continue the process until the least significant digit is processed.\n\nExample of LSD Radix Sort\n\nConsider sorting the following list of integers:\n\n\n[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\n\n\nStep-by-Step Process\n\n1. Sort by the least significant digit (units place):\n\n   \n   [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]\n   \n\n2. Sort by the next significant digit (tens place):\n\n   \n   [802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]\n   \n\n3. Sort by the most significant digit (hundreds place):\n\n   \n   [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]\n   \n\nThe list is now sorted.\n\nAdvantages of Radix Sort\n\n- Efficiency: Radix sort can be faster than comparison-based sorting algorithms (like quicksort, mergesort) when the range of the keys (digits) is not too large.\n- Simplicity: The algorithm is simple and can be implemented easily for integer keys.\n- Stability: Radix sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of records with equal keys.\n\nDisadvantages of Radix Sort\n\n- Memory Usage: Radix sort requires additional memory for temporary storage during sorting.\n- Limited Applicability: Radix sort is not suitable for all types of data, particularly for floating-point numbers or strings with varying lengths.\n\nImplementation in Java\n\nHere's a Java implementation of LSD radix sort:\n\njava\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class RadixSort {\n\n    public static void radixSort(int[] arr) {\n        int max = Arrays.stream(arr).max().getAsInt();\n        int exp = 1;\n        while (max / exp > 0) {\n            countingSort(arr, exp);\n            exp *= 10;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void countingSort(int[] arr, int exp) {\n        int n = arr.length;\n        int[] output = new int[n];\n        int[] count = new int[10];\n        \n        // Store the count of occurrences in count[]\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int index = (arr[i] / exp) % 10;\n            count[index]++;\n        }\n        \n        // Change count[i] so that it contains the actual position of this digit in output[], We transform this array so that each entry at index i contains the cumulative sum of counts up to i. This tells us the position where each digit should be placed in the output array. \n        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {\n            count[i] += count[i - 1];\n        }\n        \n        // Build the output array\n        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            int index = (arr[i] / exp) % 10;\n            output[count[index] - 1] = arr[i];\n            count[index]--;\n        }\n        \n        // Copy the output array to arr[], so that arr now contains sorted numbers according to the current digit\n        System.arraycopy(output, 0, arr, 0, n);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] arr = {170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66};\n        radixSort(arr);\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr)); // Output: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]\n    }\n}\n\n\nExplanation\n\n1. Counting Sort Function:\n   - A helper function that sorts elements based on the current digit (specified by `exp`).\n\n2. Radix Sort Function:\n   - It repeatedly calls the counting sort for each digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.\n   - `exp` is used to isolate each digit.\n\nRadix sort can be very efficient for specific types of data, especially when the number of digits (d) and the range of digits (k) are relatively small. It avoids the (O(n log n)) lower bound of comparison-based sorting algorithms, making it useful in certain scenarios.\n\nTime and Space Complexities\n\nTime Complexity:\n- Average Case: (O(d. (n + k)))\n- Worst Case: (O(d. (n + k)))\n  - Where (d) is the number of digits in the largest number (or length of the longest string), (n) is the number of elements, and (k) is the range of the digits (e.g., 0-9 for decimal numbers).\n\nSpace Complexity:\n- Auxiliary Space: (O(n + k))\n  - Additional space is used to create buckets for grouping digits or characters. The space complexity depends on the number of elements (n) and the range of digits (k).\n",
    "Time Complexity of Radix Sort\n\nThe time complexity of Radix Sort is determined by the following factors:\n- (d): The number of digits in the largest number (or the length of the longest string if sorting strings).\n- (n): The number of elements in the input array.\n- (k): The range of the digits (for decimal numbers, (k) is 10, since digits range from 0 to 9).\n\nThe overall time complexity is given by (O(d (n + k))).\n\n#Breaking it Down:\n1. Counting Sort Complexity: \n   - Counting Sort is used as a subroutine within Radix Sort.\n   - The time complexity of Counting Sort is (O(n + k)).\n\n2. Number of Passes (d):\n   - Radix Sort performs Counting Sort for each digit. If the maximum number in the array has (d) digits, then there will be (d) passes.\n   - Therefore, the total time complexity of Radix Sort is (O(d (n + k))).\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Average Case: (O(d (n + k)))\n   - This is the expected performance in general situations.\n\n2. Worst Case: (O(d (n + k)))\n   - This is also the performance in the worst-case scenario since Radix Sort does not have a different behavior for worst-case inputs as some other sorting algorithms might.\n\nComparing with Other Complexities:\n- Linear Time Complexity: (O(n))\n  - Radix Sort can achieve linear time complexity if (d) and (k) are constant values or do not grow with (n). For example, if all numbers have a fixed number of digits and the digit range is fixed.\n  \n- Quadratic Time Complexity: (O(n^2))\n  - Radix Sort does not reach (O(n^2)) time complexity unless (d) and (k) are very large in relation to (n), which is uncommon in practical scenarios. In typical uses, (d) and (k) are much smaller compared to (n), leading to a more efficient sort than (O(n^2)).\n\nBest Time Complexity:\nThe best time complexity of Radix Sort is (O(n)). This occurs under the following conditions:\n- (d) (number of digits) is a small constant.\n- (k) (range of digits) is also a small constant.\n\nIn such cases, the overall time complexity simplifies to (O(n)), since (d) and (k) do not grow with (n).\n\nSummary:\n- Average Case Time Complexity: (O(d (n + k)))\n- Worst Case Time Complexity: (O(d (n + k)))\n- Best Case Time Complexity: (O(n)) (when (d) and (k) are constants)\n\nRadix Sort is very efficient when the number of digits (d) and the range (k) are relatively small compared to the number of elements (n). It provides a linear time sorting alternative in such scenarios, outperforming typical comparison-based sorts like Quick Sort and Merge Sort which have (O(n log n)) time complexity."
