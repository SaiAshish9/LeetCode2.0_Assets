  "biconnected_component": [
    "Biconnected components in a network are essentially the edges that, if removed, would disconnect the network. These are crucial for maintaining connectivity within the network.",
    "The problem typically involves representing a network as a graph, where nodes represent entities (such as computers or routers) and edges represent connections between these entities. The task is to find all the critical connections in the network, i.e., the edges whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the graph.",
    "One common approach to solving this problem is by using Tarjan's algorithm for finding articulation points and bridges in an undirected graph. In this algorithm, you perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph, keeping track of certain properties of the nodes and edges encountered during the traversal.",
    "Here's a high-level overview of the algorithm:",
    "1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph, starting from any node",
    "2. During the traversal, maintain a timestamp for each node indicating when it was visited.",
    "3. Keep track of the lowest timestamp reachable from each node in the DFS traversal, which helps in identifying back edges.",
    "4. If you encounter a back edge (an edge to an ancestor in the DFS tree), update the lowest reachable timestamp for the corresponding node.",
    "5. If the lowest reachable timestamp of a child node is greater than or equal to the timestamp of the current node, then the edge connecting them is a critical connection.",
    "By applying Tarjan's algorithm, you can identify all the critical connections in the network efficiently. This algorithm typically runs in linear time complexity relative to the size of the graph.",
    "Once you've identified the critical connections, you can return them as a list of edges."

  "rejection_sampling": [
    "Rejection Sampling typically involves generating random samples that meet specific criteria or fit a desired distribution. This concept can be illustrated through a few representative problems on LeetCode. Below, I'll explain the concept using one of the common LeetCode problems that involve rejection sampling.",
    "LeetCode Problem: Implement Rand10() Using Rand7() (LeetCode 470)",
    "Problem Statement:",
    "You have a function rand7() that generates a random integer from 1 to 7. You need to write a function rand10() that generates a random integer from 1 to 10 uniformly using rand7().",
    "Rejection Sampling Approach:",
    "The key idea behind using rejection sampling for this problem is to transform the output of rand7() to achieve a uniform distribution over a different range (1 to 10) by generating a larger set of candidate numbers and then rejecting those that do not fit the desired criteria.",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how rejection sampling can be applied to this problem:",
    "Generate a Candidate from rand7():",
    "Use rand7() twice to generate a number in the range 1 to 49. This can be done by interpreting the results of two rand7() calls as digits in a base-7 number.\nSpecifically, compute the candidate number as (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7(). This generates a uniform integer in the range 1 to 49 because rand7() produces each number 1 through 7 with equal probability.",
    "Reject or Accept the Candidate:",
    "Since 49 is not a multiple of 10, not all numbers from 1 to 49 map evenly to the range 1 to 10. To maintain uniformity, we only accept numbers in the range 1 to 40 because 40 is the largest multiple of 10 less than 49.\nIf the generated number falls within this range (1 to 40), we map it to the range 1 to 10 using modulo operation and return the result.\nIf the number is outside this range (41 to 49), we reject it and repeat the process.",
    "Implementation in Python",
    "Hereâ€™s how the rejection sampling algorithm can be implemented:",
    "import random\n\ndef rand7():\n    return random.randint(1, 7)\n\ndef rand10():\n    while True:\n        num = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7()  # Generate a number in the range 1 to 49\n        if num <= 40:  # Accept only if the number is in the range 1 to 40\n            return 1 + (num - 1) % 10  # Map to range 1 to 10",
    "print([rand10() for _ in range(10)])",
    "Detailed Explanation:",
    "Generate Candidate: (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7() produces a number from 1 to 49 because rand7() generates a number from 1 to 7, and multiplying by 7 shifts the range accordingly.",
    "Acceptance Condition: if num <= 40 ensures we only consider numbers that can be mapped uniformly to 1 to 10.",
    "Mapping: 1 + (num - 1) % 10 converts the accepted number to the desired range 1 to 10.",
    "By only accepting numbers from 1 to 40, we ensure that each number from 1 to 10 can be mapped equally using modulo operation. Numbers 41 to 49 are rejected to avoid bias.",
    "This example illustrates how rejection sampling can be used to transform a random number generator into a uniform random generator over a different range. The key steps are generating a candidate, checking if it falls within the acceptable range, and rejecting or accepting it based on that criterion. This ensures that the resulting distribution is uniform and meets the problem requirements."
