  "biconnected_component": "Biconnected components in a network are essentially the edges\n              that, if removed, would disconnect the network. These are crucial\n              for maintaining connectivity within the network.\n              \n\n              \n\n              The problem typically involves representing a network as a graph,\n              where nodes represent entities (such as computers or routers) and\n              edges represent connections between these entities. The task is to\n              find all the critical connections in the network, i.e., the edges\n              whose removal would increase the number of connected components in\n              the graph.\n              \n\n              \n\n              One common approach to solving this problem is by using Tarjan\"s\n              algorithm for finding articulation points and bridges in an\n              undirected graph. In this algorithm, you perform a depth-first\n              search (DFS) on the graph, keeping track of certain properties of\n              the nodes and edges encountered during the traversal.\n              \n\n              \n\n              Here\"s a high-level overview of the algorithm:\n              \n\n              1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph, starting from any node.\n              \n\n              2. During the traversal, maintain a timestamp for each node\n              indicating when it was visited.\n              \n\n              3. Keep track of the lowest timestamp reachable from each node in\n              the DFS traversal, which helps in identifying back edges. \n\n              4. If you encounter a back edge (an edge to an ancestor in the DFS\n              tree), update the lowest reachable timestamp for the corresponding\n              node. \n\n              5. If the lowest reachable timestamp of a child node is greater\n              than or equal to the timestamp of the current node, then the edge\n              connecting them is a critical connection.\n              \n \n\n              By applying Tarjan\"s algorithm, you can identify all the critical\n              connections in the network efficiently.\n              \n \n\n              This algorithm typically runs in linear time complexity relative\n              to the size of the graph."
